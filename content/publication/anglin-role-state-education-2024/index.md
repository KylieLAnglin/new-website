abstract: School districts are traditionally subject to a variety of state regulations
  on educational inputs. Absent regulations, policymakers fear that districts will
  make inappropriate decisions. However, it is also possible that regulations hinder
  schools from optimizing student learning. This article tests the salience of these
  hypotheses by estimating the impact of the Texas District of Innovation statute,
  which allows districts to opt out of regulations on inputs like teacher certification
  and class sizes. Using web-scraped implementation data, I document widespread exemptions
  and variation in regulatory preferences. However, staggered difference-in-differences
  analyses demonstrate a limited impact of deregulation within 4 years, suggesting
  that deregulation alone is a relatively weak lever for spurring innovation and changing
  the state of education.
