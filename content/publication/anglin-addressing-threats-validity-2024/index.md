abstract: Given the rapid adoption of machine learning methods by education researchers,
  and the growing acknowledgment of their inherent risks, there is an urgent need
  for tailored methodological guidance on how to improve and evaluate the validity
  of inferences drawn from these methods. Drawing on an integrative literature review
  and extending a well-known framework for theorizing validity in the social sciences,
  this article provides both an overview of threats to validity in supervised machine
  learning and plausible approaches for addressing such threats. It collates a list
  of current best practices, brings supervised learning challenges into a unified
  conceptual framework, and offers a straightforward reference guide on crucial validity
  considerations. Finally, it proposes a novel research protocol for researchers to
  use during project planning and for reviewers and scholars to use when evaluating
  the validity of supervised machine learning applications.
